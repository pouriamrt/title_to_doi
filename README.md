# TitleToDOI

Tools for converting research paper titles into [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) (Digital Object Identifier) links using the [CrossRef REST API](https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/rest-api/).

---

## Features

- üîé **Automatic DOI Lookup** ‚Äì simple function for retrieving a DOI from a title.
- üåê **Web Interface** ‚Äì `app.py` exposes a tiny Flask app for searching from the browser.
- üìë **Batch Processing** ‚Äì `program.py` demonstrates how to add DOIs to rows in an Excel sheet.
- ü§ù **Respectful API Usage** ‚Äì every request sets a friendly User-Agent as recommended by CrossRef.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) ‚Äì required
- [`flask`](https://pypi.org/project/flask/) ‚Äì for the web app
- [`pandas`](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [`tqdm`](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) ‚Äì for Excel processing

Install the packages you need with:

```bash
pip install requests flask pandas tqdm
```

## Usage

### Lookup a single title

Use the `title_to_doi` function directly in your own code:

```python
from program import title_to_doi

doi = title_to_doi("Attention Is All You Need")
print(doi)
```

### Run the web app

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit <http://localhost:8080> and enter a paper title. If a DOI is found it will be displayed and linked.

### Process an Excel sheet

`program.py` expects an Excel file named `picos_compliance_results.xlsx` in the parent directory.  For each row the script looks up the DOI and writes the results to `picos_compliance_results_with_doi.xlsx`.

---

## How It Works

1. **Title Search:** Sends the given title as a query to the CrossRef REST API.
2. **Result Filtering:** Checks if the returned title closely matches the input; if so, returns the DOI.
3. **Fallback:** If the best match isn't perfect, still returns the top result‚Äôs DOI for convenience.
4. **Output:** Displays the found DOI or a ‚Äúnot found‚Äù message.

## Notes & Limitations

- Results depend on CrossRef‚Äôs indexing and may not be perfect for ambiguous or very short titles.
- For best results, use complete and exact paper titles.
